---

## Unit Tests (login.test.js)

### Test 1: Form Initialization
**Test**: Form loads with empty fields and no error messages
**Expected**: Email and password inputs are empty, error spans are empty
**Purpose**: Verify clean initial state

### Test 2: Missing Email Error
**Test**: Submit form without email
**Expected**: Show "Enter your email" error message
**Purpose**: Validate required field validation

### Test 3: Missing Password Error
**Test**: Submit form without password
**Expected**: Show "Enter your password" error message
**Purpose**: Validate required field validation

### Test 4: Both Fields Empty
**Test**: Submit with both email and password empty
**Expected**: Show both error messages
**Purpose**: Verify multiple error handling

### Test 5: Whitespace-Only Email
**Test**: Submit form with email as "   " (spaces only)
**Expected**: Show "Enter your email" error (after trim)
**Purpose**: Validate trimming behavior

### Test 6: Successful Login
**Test**: Submit valid credentials, API returns 200 OK
**Expected**: Redirect to dashboard.html after 1 second
**Purpose**: Verify happy path flow

### Test 7: Login Failure - Invalid Credentials
**Test**: Valid format but API returns 401 with error message
**Expected**: Display API error message to user
**Purpose**: Handle authentication failures gracefully

### Test 8: Network Error
**Test**: Fetch call throws error (network unreachable)
**Expected**: Show "Network error" message in general error area
**Purpose**: Handle offline scenarios

### Test 9: Malformed Error Response
**Test**: API returns error status but invalid JSON
**Expected**: Show "Login failed" default message
**Purpose**: Graceful degradation when API response is malformed

### Test 10: Error Clearing Between Submissions
**Test**: Submit twice with different errors
**Expected**: Previous errors clear, new errors display
**Purpose**: Verify error state management

### Test 11: Form Prevents Default Behavior
**Test**: Check if preventDefault is called on form submit
**Expected**: Default form submission is prevented
**Purpose**: Ensure form doesn't trigger page reload

### Test 12: Special Characters in Email
**Test**: Submit email with special characters (user+tag@example.co.uk)
**Expected**: No client validation error, submitted to API
**Purpose**: Allow valid special characters in emails

### Test 13: Very Long Email
**Test**: Submit email with 200+ characters
**Expected**: Submitted to API (server handles length validation)
**Purpose**: Server-side validation responsibility

### Test 14: HTTP Method and Headers
**Test**: Verify POST method and Content-Type header
**Expected**: fetch called with POST method and application/json header
**Purpose**: Verify API contract compliance

### Test 15: Password Not in URL
**Test**: Verify password is in POST body, not in URL
**Expected**: URL clean, password only in request body
**Purpose**: Security - no password exposure in logs/URLs

## Edge Cases & Regression Testing

### Edge Case 1: XSS Prevention
```
Test: Enter JavaScript in email field
Input: <script>alert('xss')</script>@example.com
Expected: 
- Should be rejected by client validation (invalid format)
- Or sent to server which sanitizes
- No alert appears
```

### Edge Case 2: SQL Injection Attempt
```
Test: SQL injection payload in password
Input: Password: ' OR '1'='1
Expected:
- Sent to backend
- Backend validates and rejects (no injection)
- Error message returned
```

### Edge Case 3: Very Long Email
```
Test: Email > 254 characters
Expected:
- Accepts in form (client doesn't limit)
- Sent to backend
- Backend returns validation error
- Error displayed to user
```

### Edge Case 4: Unicode Characters
```
Test: Email with unicode: tëst@example.com
Expected:
- Client: May pass (depends on validation regex)
- Server: Validates and either accepts or rejects
- Appropriate error message shown
```

### Edge Case 5: Rapid Successive Submissions
```
Test: Click submit button multiple times rapidly
Expected:
- First request sent
- Button disabled during loading
- Subsequent clicks have no effect
- Only one request reaches server
```

### Edge Case 6: Session Timeout During Login
```
Test: Server session expires mid-request
Expected:
- API returns 401 or 403
- Error message: "Session expired. Please login again."
- User can retry with new session
```

### Edge Case 7: Server Error (500)

Expected:
- User sees: "Server error. Please try again later."
- Not specific error details (security)
- User can retry
```

### Edge Case 8: Rate Limiting (429)
```
Test: Too many login attempts
Expected:
- API returns 429 status
- User sees: "Too many login attempts. Please try again later."
- Button remains clickable for retry after delay
```

### Edge Case 9: CORS Error
```
Test: Frontend makes cross-origin request without CORS headers
Expected:
- Browser blocks request
- Network error shown
- User sees: "Cannot reach the server..."
```

### Edge Case 10: Browser Back Button After Login
```
Test: 
1. Login successfully and redirect to dashboard
